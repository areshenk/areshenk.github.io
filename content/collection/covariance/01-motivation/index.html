<h2>Covariance in a single dimension</h2>
<p>In this and the following posts, we’ll return repeatedly to the case of a univariate random variable, in which case the covariance reduces to the ordinary variance. This will let us test out computations in a simple setting, and will also provide good intuition. In particular, many of the differentio-geometric properties of the covariance have simple interpretations in the one-dimensional case, which are helpful for building intuition for some of the concepts we’ll be discussing without digging too deep into the mathematical concepts themselves.</p>
<p>For now, we’ll be a bit loose and, for example, ignore the distinction between the variance of a sample and a distribution. We recall the sample variance
<span class="math display">\[ s^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i (x_i - \bar{x}) \]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the sample size and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is the sample mean. We’re not going to bother with whether we divide by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> – the only thing we care about is the observation that the variance is the <em>average squared distance from the mean</em>, which provides good enough intuition for why the calculation gives us a measure of spread.</p>
<p>Note that it follows immediately that <span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span> must be greater than or equal to zero, and is zero exactly when all observations are equal to the mean (that is, when the sample is constant). This is a degenerate case, and we’ll almost always assume that the variance is positive, but keep this boundary case in mind. In fact, we’ll take this a little bit further and <em>identify</em> the variance with the non-negative real numbers <span class="math inline">\([0, \infty)\)</span>. Think of this as the “space” of variances.</p>
<div id="three-views-on-the-variance" class="section level3">
<h3>Three views on the variance</h3>
<p>We already know that the variance can be seen as a measure of the spread of a sample or distribution. Here are two other perspectives that will be useful to us:</p>
<div id="variance-as-a-transformation" class="section level4">
<h4>Variance as a transformation</h4>
<p>It is a basic property of the variance that for any random variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> with variance <span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span>, and any real number <span class="math inline">\(a \geq 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(ax\)</span> has variance <span class="math inline">\(a^2s^2\)</span>. In other words, variances scale quadratically. We can take a perspective on this that will be useful later: Every variance <span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span> has an associated value <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> (the square root, or the standard deviation in this case, but forget about that) that transforms (by multiplication) a random variable with variance <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to have variance <span class="math inline">\(s^2\)</span>. As a particular useful example: Suppose we want to transform a random variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> with variance <span class="math inline">\(s_1^2\)</span> to one with variance <span class="math inline">\(s_2^2\)</span>. First, we can “whiten” <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> by applying <span class="math inline">\((s_1^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}x = \frac{1}{s_1}x\)</span> to achieve a unit variance, and then apply <span class="math inline">\((s_2)(s_1^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}x = \frac{s_2}{s_1}x\)</span> to get a variance of <span class="math inline">\(s_2^2\)</span>.</p>
