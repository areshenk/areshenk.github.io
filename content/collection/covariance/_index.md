A series of short articles on the meaning and properties of covariance, with a focus on the algebraic and geometric properties of high-dimensional covariance matrices. The goal is to give some basic intuition for the cone of symmetric, positive-definite matrices, which is the proper setting for the statistical analysis of covariance matrix valued data.
