<h2>Basic principles</h2>
<p>A good organizational scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enforces good habits</strong>. The organization should constrain your workflow enough that you’re forced to practice good coding and research practices.</li>
<li><strong>Is reproducible</strong>. The organization should cover the entire workflow, from raw data to polished figures. A naive observer should be able to understand the organization of the project and replicate the analysis with a minimum of effort.</li>
<li><strong>Is interpretable</strong>. The organization should be simple enough to be interpretable to a naive observer. It should be possible to send a project folder to a collaborator without needing to explain the data or code in detail.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a lab setting, where you’re likely to have many separate projects, and to be collaborating with other colleagues, there are a few other considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure should be general and flexible. It’s tempting to tailor the organization to the specific data or research question associated with a particular project, but this tends to result in projects with wildly different organizations, which defeats the purpose. Picking a general template and sticking with it – even if it’s clunky or awkward for an individual project – makes it easier to collaborate, and easier to return to the project after taking a break.</li>
<li>There should be a common interface for dealing with shared datasets. Having every member of a lab host separate copies of the data from a single experiment leads to inconsistencies between separate analyses and confusion over the authentic version of the raw data.</li>
</ul>
