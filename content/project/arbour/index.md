**arbour** is an R package (in early progress) designed for managing research project directories. The goal of the package is to facilitate reproducibility by maintaining a consistent directory organization, and providing convenient tools for indexing code, figures, and data associated with each project. The project is under early and rapid development, and so contains only minimal tools for initializing project directory structures.

### Installation

**arbour** can be installed from GitHub with using `install_git()` from the `devtools` package using the command below:

`devtools::install_git('areshenk-rpackages/arbour')`
