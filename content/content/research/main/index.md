  I am a doctoral candidate at the Centre for Neuroscience Studies at Queens University, working in the Memory, Action, and Perception Lab under Dr. Jason Gallivan. My research focuses largely on the contribution of explicit processes to sensorimotor learning and control -- that is, in addition to trial-by-trial learning by reinforcement or sensory errors, I am interested in the ways that people leverage cognitive strategies to achieve rapid gains in performance. My work uses both behavioral experiments and functional MRI to characterize brain networks supporting these processes, and to disentangle neural systems supporting different forms of motor learning.

  More generally, I'm interested in principled methods for studying functional brain networks. On the applied side, I've developed a software toolbox (spdm) implementing a variety of techniques based on Riemannian geometry for the analysis and manipulation of covariance matrices.
