        <p>If you&rsquo;re an incoming graduate student in a research discipline, you&rsquo;ve probably taken part in at least some aspect of the research process during your undergraduate education. Most research assistants start out doing grunt work; like running participants, shuffling data around, or computing simple summary statistics. Often, undergraduates are attached to more senior lab members who perform the more complex tasks themselves, and give the less experienced students the polished data they need to perform their analyses. This means that, while many new graduate students have been <em>involved</em> in the running, analysis, and write-up of an experiment, they haven&rsquo;t actually had experience with all the boring technical aspects of organizing a complete research project.</p>
<p>Graduate coursework is generally focused on providing whatever theoretical background and minimal statistical knowledge is needed to take part in basic research in the student&rsquo;s field, but the practical aspects of conducting that research are usually left to acquired by experience. Unless a lab dedicates formal time to teaching these skills, this usually means that students learn by collaborating with other students (if they&rsquo;re lucky) or by slowly figuring out bits and pieces for themselves, and so develop a mix of idiosyncratic practices more or less by osmosis.</p>
<p>Most labs, over time, develop a consistent set of research methods and techniques, which have to be formally taught to new students almost by necessity. Neuroimaging, for example, isn&rsquo;t something that can reasonably be learned by new students through self-study; and when I started my doctoral work, there were formal procedures in place to train new students in the use of fMRI. On the other hand, issues like how a student should deal with the huge quantity of data produced by an imaging experiment, how they should organize their code, how they should put together a project directory, how they should create/organize their figures, and more generally how they should approach organizing a large scale research project, are generally left for them to figure out on their own. The general problem here is that these issues impact the efficiency of the student&rsquo;s work, its replicability, and the likelihood of errors. On a more concrete level, this means that a lot of students are just terrible collaborators; their code is messy, their projects are disorganized and undocumented, and every one of them uses completely different tools. Science is fundamentally collaborative, and part of being a good collaborator is doing work that can be easily communicated, and working in a way that makes it easy for others to contribute.</p>
<p>Any of the following are signs that a student (who may otherwise be perfectly knowledgeable and experienced) is, overall, just disorganized, or otherwise hasn&rsquo;t put much thought into the minor technical details of their research:</p>
<ul>
<li>A student is asked to share some data, and emails an undocumented, proprietary data file (such as an <code>.m</code> or <code>.xlsx</code> file with no header) along with a lengthy diatribe explaining the meaning of each column. The variable coding is uninformative, and groups or factor variables are coded numerically rather than with interpretable labels. <strong>There is probably no explicit lab standard dictating how data are to be formatted or shared.</strong></li>
<li>A student is asked to share their code so that another student can replicate an analysis. They supply single <code>.R</code> file with several hundred lines containing the entire preprocessing and analysis pipeline. The data are imported from a hard-coded file path, and some of the code is slightly out of order, so that it has to be executed line by line to function properly. You want to change some parameters, but the values of those parameters are hard coded throughout the document, so that you need to hunt for them throughout the file and hope you don&rsquo;t miss any. <strong>The student writes bad code. More importantly, they haven&rsquo;t learned to <em>structure</em> their code in a way that makes their analysis replicable.</strong></li>
<li>A student is returning to an analysis after a short break, or has been asked to share data and code so that another greoup can replicate an analysis. The raw data, code, and figures are contained in a single folder with no organization. There are multiple code files with names like <code>analysis</code> and <code>analysis_new</code>. The correct file is <code>analysis</code>, since <code>analysis_new</code> was writen after the student had an idea for an alternative analysis, but that didn&rsquo;t pan out so the original analysis is what was published. The file <code>importdata</code> is not used, since the student got tired of having to run two scripts and just pasted all of code into the <code>analysis</code> file. No one has any idea what the hell is happening. <strong>The student never made the transition from <em>drafting</em> code, to putting together an organized and finalized version of the analysis</strong>.</li>
<li>Poorly formatted, pixelated images in a poster or paper. Almost always clearly made using the default settings in Microsoft Excel. Many of these figures use color unecessarily, have poor contrast ratios, are not colorblind friendly, or otherwise use design elements that don&rsquo;t efficiently communicate information. <strong>The student has probably seen better figures in a published paper, but has never been taught how to create them.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Almost all of these problems are a direct result of students not having enough collaborative experience, since working with a team teaches you very quickly how to be organized: Either other team members let you know that your work is not understandable, the team puts together explicit rules, or you experience these problems in other people&rsquo;s work and realize that you need to fix them in your own. Labs can foster these kinds of skills either by encouraging collaboration, or by teaching them explicitly. The benefit of the latter approach, and of developing some kind of formalized set of research practices, is that it avoids some of the problems that tend to come up when students work independently on their own research projects &ndash; as graduate students tend to do. Some sure signs that a lab hasn&rsquo;t put much thought into its overall organization are any one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most students use the same techniques (motion tracking, fMRI, etc), but each student has written their own code to perform basic functions common to every student&rsquo;s analyses. <strong>The lab hasn&rsquo;t invested time in building a common set of tools.</strong> The result is that new students either need to completely reinvent these tools, or borrow code from other students which results in multiple versions of the same tools floating around with no documentation or standardization.</li>
<li>Students collaborate, but each student has their own version of the data, organized in a completely different way, and only sees or has a copy of the code they personally use to perform their part of the analysis. <strong>The lab has no shared repositories or organizational standards.</strong> The result is that recreating an analysis, or even fully understanding it, requires contacting multiple separate people in the hopes that each one of them has preserved and fully documented their individual part of the workflow.</li>
<li>The lab has a &ldquo;brain drain&rdquo; &ndash; say, the seniormost students all graduate within a short timespan. The lab is now left with junior students who have to relearn basic techniques, and don&rsquo;t have the expertise to build on the work of the previous students. This is especially damaging in labs which are technologically advanced, or otherwise highly technical.</li>
</ul>
<p>A simple test of a lab&rsquo;s overall organization is this: If a new student with average background is provided with the raw data, how long would it take them to recreate the results &ndash; p-values, figures, and all &ndash; of a paper published by a senior student two years ago? That is; without having to collect new data, discover any new techniques, or innovate in any way, how long would it take them to perform the basic functions that more senior students are already performing as part of their work? This is a lower bound on the time it will take a student to begin writing up their first research paper &ndash; plus the time taken to understand the background literature, design an experiment, and collect data. Forcing them to reinvent basic tools and learn menial tasks for themselves adds months or years to the time taken to become a self-sufficient researcher.</p>
<p>The point these posts is to ask the questions: <em>How should you approach a large-scale research project if you&rsquo;re a new student?</em>; <em>How should a lab foster an environment that minimizes the time taken for students to start doing meaningful work?</em>; and, more generally, to give some quality of life advice that would have shaved some time off of my own graduate studies.</p>
<p>These notes are geared towards practices relevant to my own work, which is heavy on programming, and typically involve multiple analyses conducted on large amounts of data. More generally, they&rsquo;re relevant to any workflow of the form <em>collect data, store it on a computer, perform an analysis, create figures, write a manuscript</em>. For different workflows &ndash; say, <em>in vitro</em> work in the chemical or biological sciences &ndash; the issues are different, and presumably learning to work effectively in a wet lab requires a completely separate set of skills.</p>
