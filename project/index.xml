      <description>Symmetric, positive definite matrices in R spdm is an R package implementing operations on symmetric, positive-definite matrices (aka covariance matrices). Besides offering several forms of regularized covariance estimation, spdm is focused on geometry-respecting covariance analysis &amp;ndash; that is, operations which respect the intrinsic Riemannian manifold structure of the set of the symmetric positive-definite matrices. In my own work, these techniques are usually applied to the analysis of fMRI functional connectivity.</description>

      <description>Multiscale, multivariate sample entropy in R MSMVSampEn is an R package for computing multiscale, multivariate sample entropy using the procedure outlined by Ahmed and Mandic (2011).
Installation MSMVSampEn is designed for efficiently computing multiscale sample entropy from highly multivariate biological signals (e.g. eeg, meg, and fMRI BOLD data). The package can be installed directly from its Github repository using
devtools::install_git(&#39;https://github.com/areshenk-rpackages/MSMVSampEn&#39;)
Issues Note that the interface of MSMVSampEn is likely to undergo substantial changes in the near future in order to accommodate additional features.</description>
