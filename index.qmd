I am a researcher at the Centre for Neuroscience Studies at Queens University, working in the Memory, Action, and Perception Lab under Dr. Jason Gallivan. My background is in statistics and mathematics, and I typically enjoy projects that lend themselves to interesting or unusual analyses. Although I've dabbled in many areas, my general focus is on the use of functional neuroimaging methods to study brain networks supporting motor learning processes.
